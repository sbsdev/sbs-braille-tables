The files in this directory provide a sort of a preprocessor so that
braille tables can be written the ASCII braille notation instead of
the actual dot notation

The lines are translated according to the following rules (see also
the translate function in tab2lou.pl):

- '#'   Comment, use line as is
- '#=#' Use line as is (without the '#=#')
- '###' Source comment. Drop this line in the output
- All other lines are expected to be of the form =Opcode Input Output
  Comment= where
  - =Opcode= taken as is ('_' is translated to ' ')
  - =Input=  taken as is
  - =Output= translated with din2dots
  - =Comment= optional, taken as is
